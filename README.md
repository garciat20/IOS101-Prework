## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Spotify

-- **Daily Mixes**: Playlists created based on what you listen allows you to find music that you might've not known existed before.
-- **Listening Between Devices**: Switching between listening to an iPhone and Mac is really convenient.

App: Reddit 

-- **Subreddits**: Allows you to hand pick the type of content you want to see.
-- **Upvote/Downvote System**: Seeing how many people dislike or like a certain post or comment is pretty neat because it shows transparancy of how people feel about cerrtain content.

App: Discord

-- **Custom Servers**: Discord allows you to customize you want you're server to operate and it helps give your server a certain atmosphere.
-- **Screen Share**: The ability to share screen and hear audio from the shared screen is amazing to use with freinds.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Getting used to using the IDE was challenging because I found it frustrating to drag and drop some labels to create a connection. Not doing it properly the first time caused unexpected issues with my code when dynamically changing the text color based on the background color.

### App Idea

CommunityHelper is an app that helps people easily find medical, legal, and food resources that are affordable or free. The key features of the app would be the ability to search and filter said searches, multi-language support, reviews and ratings, and an eligibility checker in case certain resources has requirements to use them.
